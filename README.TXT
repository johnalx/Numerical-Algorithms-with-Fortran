           Numerical Library in FORTRAN 77 and quasi-Fortran 90
           ====================================================



The enclosed CD contains the FORTRAN 77 and quasi-Fortran 90 source
codes of the Numerical Library. For short we shall call this library
EFNUM (English FORTRAN version).

Experimentally we have included a special version of the source codes of
the library, which can be aquired via mouse clicks. All that is needed
to use this version is a WWW browser such as LYNX or NETSCAPE etc.
For this purpose we have translated the source codes into HTML
(version 2.0), thus adding a table of contents and a key word
index.
A trip through EFNUM begins with the file `start.htm' in the root
directory which needs to be loaded first into the browser.
We would like to learn from our users how useful this version actually
is for using and computing with EFNUM.

A third essential component of this CD are programs to operate with the
EFNUM source codes. These include the GNU FORTRAN 77 compiler for the
operating OS/2, as well as programs for handling packed files and a
universal program maintenance tool.

To locate information, use the files `00index.txt', which appear in each
subdirectory of the CD that contains files. For a broader overview, the
file `allindex.txt' contains the information of all `00index.txt'
subindexes.


Finally we include some explanations and declarations aimed to make
further descriptions on this CD easily comprehensible.

- We often call (sub)directories folders.
- All text portions on this CD use the sign / for writing out file names
  with their paths as is standard under UNIX.
- Folders in the tables of contents of this CD end in a /.
- All files of the CD satisfy the MS-DOS convention of having at most 8
  characters before the delimiting . and up to 3 following the dot.
- All text files on the CD use the line separators of MS-DOS, i.e., the
  sequence of ASCII symbols with the numbers 13 and 10, sometimes called
  CR+LF, or for C programmers "\r\n".
  If there is need to obtain the EFNUM source codes in a different
  format, we advise to use the included condensed version of EFNUM and
  the command `unzip' for the desired operating system format. The
  option `-a' ensures that the source codes are transformed
  automatically into the appropriate format. If `unzip' is not
  available, it can be recreated from its source code on the CD.
