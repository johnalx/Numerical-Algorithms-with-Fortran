In order to have a means to check correctness of the test results
computed by one's own compiler, this folder contains the test results
computed by us as follows:

- `fortra77/gnuos2/gnuout.zip' by calling

      gnutst.cmd

  inside the EFNUM source code folder with GNU FORTRAN 0.5.18 and
  emx 0.9b under OS/2 on a PC with Intel Pentium 100 processor
  and packing the resulting files with `zip'.
  `makefile.aus' from `gnuout.zip' contains the essential parts of
  the test results.
