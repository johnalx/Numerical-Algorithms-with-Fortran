This folder contains the compressed version of the FORTRAN 77 and
quasi-Fortran 90 source codes of the Numerical Library and the HTML
variant for FORTRAN 77.

All ZIP files were generated as in the following example

    zip -9@ efnum804 <efnum804.dir

The ZIP files have the advantage over the uncompressed files of being
easily portable (they fit onto one disk), and their contents can easily
be adjusted for other operating systems and their text formats by using
the `unzip -a' option.
