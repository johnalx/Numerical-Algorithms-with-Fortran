Here are the source codes of the Numerical Library EFNUM in FORTRAN 77
and quasi-Fortran 90.

A reminder: all source codes follow the MS-DOS format. If another format
is needed, we suggest to start with the compressed representation as
detailed in `readme.txt' in the root directory of this CD.

Further details are contained in the readme file in the FORTRA77 folder
and especially see the comments of source files themselves.
